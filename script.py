### Passed into root_scalar to find where the position function for y, ie s_y, intersects the even ground y=s_y0. This helper transforms the root found by root_scalar to be the solution to s_y = s_y0 (where s_y0 is adjusted for the 1.62 and -0.1 offsets applied its initialization).

### Convert a given pitch to its significant angle equivalent
